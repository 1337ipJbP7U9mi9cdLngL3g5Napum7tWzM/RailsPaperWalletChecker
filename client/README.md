Paper Wallet Checker (http://www.1337ipjbp7u9mi9cdlngl3g5napum7twzm.com/) 
is an open source, React web app, that provides an easy and secure way to check
the balances of your paper wallets.  Presently, Paper Wallet Checker (PWC) 
covers all the most important and popular cryptocurrencies, 
including BTC, ETH, BCH, Dash, ZCash, and more.  The user does not need to
register with PWC and no personal data is stored.  

Paper Wallet Checker allows the user to enter multiple addresses.  PWC verifies 
that the addresses are valid and not private addresses, before checking the
balances.  Once the addresses have been entered the user can choose to output 
the address to a spreadsheet.  In addition, the user can provide PWC a 
spreadsheet to enter the addresses.  This provides unprecedented ease of use.  

Once the addresses are entered the user can click on them and bring up a 
QR code.  This allows users to receive funds easily and securely.  PWC also 
allows users to check that the funds have been received.  PWC is designed 
to meet Andreas Antonopoulos’ standard of ‘even your mother or grandmother 
can use it’.
